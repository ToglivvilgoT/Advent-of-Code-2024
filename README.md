# Advent-of-Code-2024

My solutions for Advent of Code 2024

I do every day in python first for speed, then I (try to) do them i Haskell to practice functional programming.

After finishing a python solution, I don't clean up the code or try to increase performance. I want to keep my solutions authentic to how I solved them on that day. I do however, add docstrings, comments and type hinting to increase readability after the solution is done and submitted for that day.

I also have a template.py file, I copy this for every day to have something to start from.

I also have a test.py file where I test random things I learn along the way or want to try out.
